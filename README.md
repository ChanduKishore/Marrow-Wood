# Marrow-Wood
It's a real time strategy survival game


## Story:
Once, there was a village near the forest called Marrow Wood. One day, out of nowhere, a huge one-eyed monster attacked the village, devastating homes and scattering the people. After the disaster struck, the villagers were forced to flee into Marrow Wood.

Scattered throughout the forest, small groups of villagers began traveling south in search of safety. After several days of wandering, one group discovered a glowing rock. Around it, they found a livable environment and decided to settle there.

The glowing rock provided light during the night and seemed to support the surrounding wildlife. Mysterious eyes watched from the darkness, but no creature dared to approach the glow of the rock.

The villagers began to believe the rock possessed some kind of power that repelled evil, and they stayed within its protective glow.

One morning, a mysterious voice emanated from the glowing rock and spoke to the villagers:

Glowing Rock: Worship me. Give me your praise. I will grant you strength and help you build a new village here.

You're are the mysterious voice from the glowing rock and Villagers started worshiping you.
